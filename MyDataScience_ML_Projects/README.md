What is Machine Learning??
---------------------------

-> In simple terms, Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence, which is broadly defined as the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior.

Types:
-----
-> Supervised Machine Learning
-> Unsupervised Machine Learning
-> Reinforcement Learning

Supervised ML:
--------------
Simply, which ever data points had lables to make them trained!!!
We have -> Regression and Classification models to deal in Supervised...
We have dealt ML algos like Linear Regression, Multivariate Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest!!

Unspervised ML:
---------------
Which ever data points doesnt have labels to make them trained.
we have -> K- Means Clustering, Hierarchial clustering, Silhoutte Clustering, DBScan Clustering and many more which will discuss whenever if possible!!!

Reinforcement Learning:
-----------------------
Reinforcement learning is all about making decisions sequentially. In simple words, we can say that the output depends on the state of the current input and the next input depends on the output of the previous input.
Types: Positive and Negative RL
-> Will cover whenever we deal with it.
